# Morse Trainer

**A Bash-based Morse code trainer built with accessibility in mind.**

## About

Morse Trainer is a project born out of frustration — a frustration with the lack of accessible Morse code training software for blind users. After trying various tools (including some paid ones), and constantly running into barriers, I decided to create my own solution from scratch, using Bash.

This project is still in its early stages and far from perfect, but it’s already usable and slowly getting better. My hope is to build something that is minimal, accessible, and truly helpful for blind users who want to learn or practice Morse code using the terminal.

## Features

- Runs entirely in Bash — no GUI, no dependencies beyond core Linux utilities.
- Designed for screen reader compatibility.
- Initial support for training random letters and words in Morse.
- Focus on simplicity, clarity, and no unnecessary visual output.

## Feedback and Contributions

I’m especially interested in **constructive feedback**, accessibility improvements, and suggestions from other blind users or accessibility-conscious developers. Feel free to open an issue, start a discussion, or fork the repo and make a pull request.

If you're sighted and want to help: please remember this is primarily a tool for blind users. Fancy visuals are not the goal — clarity and usability via the terminal are.

## A Note from the Author

As a blind developer, I’ve often felt like we're an afterthought in software design. With Morse Trainer, I’m taking matters into my own hands — building something *by* and *for* people like me. If this helps even one person avoid the same frustration I’ve felt, it’s worth it.
